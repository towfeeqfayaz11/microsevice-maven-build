# build automation tools
ant       --> build.xml    (we manually need to install dependencies and place in project directories)   --> it can work even without src directory
                           -> can work independent of application
                           -> part of application automatic build+deploy
maven     --> pom.xml      (takes care of the dependencies)    (maven also requires sc directory)
                           -> can not work independent of application
                           -> part of application development  + application automatic build+deploy
gradle    --> build.gradle
